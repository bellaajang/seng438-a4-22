# Introduction

The goal of this lab was to enhance the quality and completeness of our test suite by applying mutation testing to the test cases for Range and DataUtilities from Assignment 3. Using PIT, we injected mutants into the source code and analyzed it for mutation coverage. Additionally, the assignment aimed to introduce GUI testing tools for testing one of the provided websites. For this, we used Selenium to record and replay GUI test scripts.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class
// Analysis of at least 10 mutants produced by Pitest for the Range class, and how they are killed or not by your original test suite

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class
## Range Initial Mutation Score

## DataUtilities Final Mutation Score


# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
// A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy including a discussion on how equivalent mutants could be detected
// Try to come up with a way that you could automatically detect a few equivalent mutants in your experimentation, for classes Range and DataUtilities. 
// If you think you have found a way, discuss it in your report, along with its benefits, disadvantages, and assumptions. Try to detect a few equivalent 
// mutants manually in classes Range and DataUtilities (to do this, you will need to investigate the mutation logs generated by the tool). 
// Report the process you followed for this part plus your findings and results in your lab report.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
// A discussion of how you improved the mutation score of the test suites. Your design strategy.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing



# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The instructions for this lab were often confusing. Additionally, when we encountered issues with Eclipse or the lab setup, it would have been helpful 
to include a note in the assignment markdownabout the need to import jar files from Assignment Two, and explaining how to import the sample test suites.
