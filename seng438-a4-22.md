# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class
// Analysis of at least 10 mutants produced by Pitest for the Range class, and how they are killed or not by your original test suite

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class
// All the statistics and the mutation score for each of the mutated classes (Range and DataUtilities) with each test suite class (original and the updated one)


# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
// A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy including a discussion on how equivalent mutants could be detected
// Try to come up with a way that you could automatically detect a few equivalent mutants in your experimentation, for classes Range and DataUtilities. 
// If you think you have found a way, discuss it in your report, along with its benefits, disadvantages, and assumptions. Try to detect a few equivalent 
// mutants manually in classes Range and DataUtilities (to do this, you will need to investigate the mutation logs generated by the tool). 
// Report the process you followed for this part plus your findings and results in your lab report.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
// A discussion of how you improved the mutation score of the test suites. Your design strategy.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing



# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
